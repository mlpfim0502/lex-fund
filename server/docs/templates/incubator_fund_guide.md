# Incubator Hedge Fund Guide
## Building a Track Record Before Full Launch

## WHAT IS AN INCUBATOR FUND?

An incubator fund is a cost-effective stepping stone to launching a full-fledged hedge fund. The manager contributes their own capital and manages the fund's assets for 6-12 months to:

- **Test investment strategies** in live market conditions
- **Create a verifiable track record** within the fund vehicle
- **Gather indications of interest** from prospective investors before incurring full launch costs

> **Source**: Investment Law Group developed the incubator hedge fund concept and continues to innovate the structure.

## JOHN S. LORE'S INCUBATOR FUND GUIDANCE

> *From "Forming and Operating a Hedge Fund: A Guide for Emerging Fund Managers" by John S. Lore, Esq.*

### Why an Incubator Fund?

> "Trading in a startup hedge fund involves different strategies than trading as part of an organization. Securities laws make it difficult for a manager to use prior performance figures to promote a new fund. The concept of 'cherry picking' discourages a manager from disclosing certain personal performance while omitting others."

The incubator fund solves this problem by allowing you to show **actual performance in the same entity structure** that will eventually be used for the fund vehicle.

### Structure (Lore)

> "An incubator fund is an investment fund structure comprised of a limited partnership as the fund entity and an LLC as the management company entity. The same entities will eventually be used for the hedge fund."

Unlike a full hedge fund, an incubator fund does not include:
- Securities offering documents
- Regulatory filings necessary to sell to outside investors

### Minimal Regulatory Requirements

> "Because an incubator fund does not have outside investors, it is generally not subject to many of the regulatory and filing requirements required by federal and state law, such as investment advisor registration, commodities registration and Form D filing."

**However**, check with a hedge fund attorney prior to concluding which regulatory requirements must be satisfied.

### Self-Funded Only

> "With very few exceptions, the incubator fund should not accept outside investors. Even investment from close friends and family can run afoul of state and federal securities law. Likewise, a sponsor should not borrow capital from others to invest in the incubator fund."

**Consult a hedge fund attorney prior to accepting any outside funds from any source.**

### Tax Treatment

> "An incubator fund is generally set up using a pass-through fund entity (typically a Delaware limited partnership). The fund's realized income and gains are only taxed at the individual level. Tax gains and loss pass through to an investor's tax return. Items on Schedule K-1 retain their tax character for the manager."

### Timeline

> "Incubator funds typically remain in place from three to twelve months, during which time the managers can contemporaneously prepare for any applicable FINRA examinations, file for regulatory registrations, prepare the fund's marketing documents, website, and work with legal counsel to prepare the fund's offering documents."

### Transition to Full Hedge Fund

> "To transition to a hedge fund, legal counsel will assist the fund managers in the preparation of formal offering documents. Will include a private offering memorandum, partnership agreement, and subscription documents, as well as the necessary regulatory filings and applicable registrations."

### Cost Efficiency

> "An incubator fund significantly reduces start-up capital risk while the strategy is tested. The cost to form an incubator fund is considerably lower than the cost to form a hedge fund. The incubator fund can be easily transitioned to a full hedge fund once the fund sponsors have established a performance record (usually between three to twelve months)."
