**Scenario**: $1M investment, 15% annual return, 2/20 fee structure with 6% soft hurdle

```
Beginning NAV:           $1,000,000
Gross Return (15%):      $  150,000
Ending NAV (before fees): $1,150,000

Step 1: Check Hurdle
  Hurdle = 6% × $1,000,000 = $60,000
  Actual profit = $150,000 > $60,000 ✓ Hurdle exceeded

Step 2: Management Fee
  2% × $1,000,000 = $20,000

Step 3: Performance Fee (soft hurdle - applies to ALL profit)
  20% × $150,000 = $30,000

Step 4: Net to Investor
  $1,150,000 - $20,000 - $30,000 = $1,100,000
  Net Return: 10.0%
